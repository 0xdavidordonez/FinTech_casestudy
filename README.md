# Real Estate ROI Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description

This repository contains code to predict the **Return on Investment (ROI)** for real estate properties using machine learning algorithms. The code is written in `C#` and leverages the **Microsoft ML.NET library**.

### Repository Structure :file_folder:

- `RealEstateData.cs`: Defines the data model for the real estate properties, including various features like location score, square footage, age of the property, and so on.
  
- `Program.cs`: Contains the main program where the machine learning pipeline is defined, the model is trained, and predictions are made.

## Features :hammer_and_wrench:

The following features are used for the prediction:

- **Location Score**
- **Square Footage**
- **Age of Property**
- **Vacancy Rate**
- **Market Growth**
- **Interest Rate**
- **Property Tax**
- **Operating Expenses**
- **Net Operating Income**
- **Price**

The target variable for prediction is **ROI (Return on Investment)**.

## How to Run :running_man:

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Open the solution in your preferred IDE for C#** (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. **Install the ML.NET NuGet package** if not already installed.
4. **Run the program.**

## Output :bar_chart:

The output will be the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** of the model on the test set, giving you an idea of how well the model is performing.
